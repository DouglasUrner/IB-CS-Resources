IB Computer Science Resources
=====

Resources for teaching IB CS. Pull requests are welcome.

## Intro / Pre-IB CS Resources

* [Exploring Computer Science](http://exploringcs.org) (ECS) – this is an excellent introduction to CS. The curriculum is designed to scaffold learning for "non-traditional" CS students and the materials are created with the explicit intention of supporting equity in CS education. The section on Problem Solving is an excellent introduction to problem solving and computational thinking. It would be a good MYP level introduction to CS.
* [CS Unplugged](http://csunplugged.com) – resources for teaching CS without a computer. The activities around algorithms work well at the high school level (late MYP, even DP). There is a downloadable text and online resources.
* [Hour of Code](http://code.org) – activities around a one class period introduction to programming and computer science.

## Organizations Supporting CS Education

* [Black Girls Code](http://www.blackgirlscode.com) – [TED Talk by founder Kimberly Bryant](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TJ-m47CxAI0)
* [Code.org](http://code.org) –

## Books

* [Practical Object-Oriented Design in Ruby:
An Agile Primer](http://poodr.com), by Sandi Metz – this book is an easily read (almost) introduction to OOP and Agile methods using Ruby. It is not a Ruby text, but the Ruby examples are quite accessible. An added bonus is that the author is a woman, so you get a positive role model at the same time.

* [Code Complete](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_Complete), by Steve McConnell – a huge, and very readable text on software development methodology. Either edition is usable.

* [TCP/IP Illustrated](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TCP/IP_Illustrated), by W. Richard Stephens – this is a three-volume set of books that provide an accessible, in-depth, look at the TCP/IP protocol suite. The books were first published in 1994 and have been revised a couple of times since. The core ideas haven't changed much, so if you are on a budget get the early editions – you can often get very good deals on them.

  The genius of these books is the job Stephens does of explaining the thought process that lets you learn first hand about networking protocols. I highly, highly recommend these as a classroom resource.

## Pair Programming

Pair programming is a collaborative programming method that is used in industry – many effective teams use it as their dominant method, and some use it exclusively – and in educational settings to improve the productivity of programmers and the quality of the code they produce. It can encourage collaborative learning if taught and organized well (and it also stretches computer resources).

Some of the best resources/practices I've seen for introducing and coaching pair programming with adults are from the [Global Day of Code Retreat](http://globalday.coderetreat.org). I think these methods would work well with students too, but I haven't tried them yet.

Pair programming aligns well with Agile methods.

### Videos of pair programming teams at work

The (serious, productive) interactions between the driver and navigator in a pair programming team are the core of the practice. I'm looking for some video of good teams at work, as it is kind of hard to explain to students what these interactions look and feel like.

If you know of any, please send me a pull request.

### Other pair programming resources

* [Pair Programming-in-a-Box: The Power of Collaborative Learning](http://www.ncwit.org/resources/pair-programming-box-power-collaborative-learning) – the [National Center for Women & IT](http://www.ncwit.org)'s guide to pair programming as a learning technique (as opposed to a working method for professionals). The materials are aimed at college courses and would need to be modified for high school use. The package consists of a 32-page PDF and four Word documents (student guide, teacher guide, questionnaire, and a survey) that can be adapted to your situation.

## Software / Development Tools

* [GitHub](https://github.com) – online developer community built around the git version control system. Offers educational tools and web hosting. The site is the repository for many open source projects and exposure to it would provide students with valuable experience and insight into "real world" softeware development and collaboration.

* [Atom](http://atom.io) – open source programmer's editor loosely reminiscent of [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com). Freely available and runs on OS X, Linux, and Windows.

* [JetBrains](https://www.jetbrains.com) – commercial developer of IDEs for a number of languages / development scenarios. They have products to support Java and web development. The OO support is good. They are very supportive of educational applications. Last I checked classroom licenses were free.

* [Saleae](https://www.saleae.com) – makers of inexpensive logic analyzers with USB interfaces. The devices are very well made and they offer good pricing for educational uses.

* USB Oscilloscopes – a number of companies make USB interfaces to an oscilloscope "front end" with the display running in an application on your computer. I got one called an [Xscope Plain](http://www.gabotronics.com/oscilloscopes/xprotolab-plain.htm) for $20 US.

* **Arduino**

 The Arduino is a playing card sized single-board computer based around the Atmel Atmega328 microcontroller. Prices are relatively low (around $25 US for a single board) and there is a huge variety of project descriptions and tutorials on the web. The Arudino would be an excellent platform for an IA or EE project.

 * [Official Arudino Site](arduino.cc) – this is the canonical resource if you're looking for information and resorces related to the Aruduio. The IDE is downloadable from this site.

 * [Adafruit](http://adafruit.com) – source for components and excellent tutorials. The site is built around the idea that hacking and learning are activities worth doing and supporting. There are excellent resources and project ideas for the Aruduino, Raspberry Pi and several other similar boards. The discussion forums provide access to people working on the tutorials. The site is also great inspiration for young women exploring career ideas in CS and electronics.

* [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com) –
 The great value of Bootstrap (as a teaching tool) is that it gives students a way to (relatively) easily make a good looking website without drowning in CSS details. To do this they have to develop the skill of reading code and documentation.

## Online Resources

* [StackOverflow]() – an online question-and-answer format site with a strong bias towards CS. You'll often hit this site with searches for CS information and the answer are frequently very good.

* [IRC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Relay_Chat) – Internet Relay Chat is a tool, kind of like instant messaging from the '80s, that is used to support real-time collaboration on many open source projects. There are free IRC clients for most every OS that saw the light of day in the last 30 or so years. Many open source projects host their IRC channels on [Freenode](https://freenode.net/). You really have to experience it.

* [Udacity]() – an online "school" with many high level CS classes.

* [EdX]() – ditto.

* [TED Talks](http://ted.com) and other short videos

 My plan is to use these on Fridays, when we have short days, and as a backup plan for when I need a sub and don't have a lesson that would be easily taught by someone who doesn't know the field and/or the students.

 I assume you know about TED… If not get acquainted right now! TED is a rich source of ideas on a huge range of subjects including CS, education, globalization, social problems and solutions. Here are some of my favorites with at least tangential connections to CS (and CS education). In no particular order:

 * [Eli Pariser: Beware online "filter bubbles"](http://www.ted.com/talks/eli_pariser_beware_online_filter_bubbles) – how algorithms narrow your world – for better and worse.
 * [Kevin Slavin: How algorithms shape our world](http://www.ted.com/talks/kevin_slavin_how_algorithms_shape_our_world) - We live in a world run by algorithms, computer programs that make decisions or solve problems for us. In this riveting, funny talk, Kevin Slavin shows how modern algorithms determine stock prices, espionage tactics, even the movies you watch. But, he asks: If we depend on complex algorithms to manage our daily decisions -- when do we start to loose control of our lives.
 * [Mick Mountz: What happens inside those massive warehouses?](http://www.ted.com/talks/mick_mountz_the_hidden_world_of_box_packing) – We make millions of online purchases daily, but who (or what) actually puts our items into packages? In this talk, Mick Mountz weaves a fascinating, surprisingly robot-filled tale of what happens inside a warehouse.
 * [Amy Webb: How I hacked online dating](http://www.ted.com/talks/amy_webb_how_i_hacked_online_dating) –  Amy Webb was having no luck with online dating. The dates she liked didn't write her back, and her own profile attracted crickets (and worse). So, as any fan of data would do: she started making a spreadsheet. Hear the story of how she went on to hack her online dating life -- with frustrating, funny and life-changing results.
 * [Yochai Benkler: The new open-source economics](http://www.ted.com/talks/yochai_benkler_on_the_new_open_source_economics) – Yochai Benkler explains how collaborative projects like Wikipedia and Linux represent the next stage of human organization.

 * [Dr. Tae: Can Skateboarding Save Our Schools?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHfo17ikSpY) – skateboarding as a model for what education should be like.
 * [Ken Robinson: How to escape education's death valley](http://www.ted.com/talks/ken_robinson_how_to_escape_education_s_death_valley) – Sir Ken Robinson outlines 3 principles crucial for the human mind to flourish -- and how current education culture works against them. In a funny, stirring talk he tells us how to get out of the educational "death valley" we now face, and how to nurture our youngest generations with a climate of possibility.
 * [Robin Chase: Excuse me, may I rent your car?](http://www.ted.com/talks/robin_chase_excuse_me_may_i_rent_your_car) – Robin Chase founded ZipCar, in this talk and the next one she talks about the experience and the larger implications of how we consume and share.
 * [Robin Chase: The idea behind Zipcar (and what comes next)](http://www.ted.com/talks/robin_chase_on_zipcar_and_her_next_big_idea) – like the previous talk there are very interesting ideas about social structures that could make for interesting IA and EE topics for both CS and ITGS.
 * [Catherine Bracy: Why good hackers make good citizens](http://www.ted.com/talks/catherine_bracy_why_good_hackers_make_good_citizens) – Hacking is about more than mischief-making or political subversion. As Catherine Bracy describes in this spirited talk, it can be just as much a force for good as it is for evil. She spins through some inspiring civically-minded projects in Honolulu, Oakland and Mexico City — and makes a compelling case that we all have what it takes to get involved.

## Software Communities

* [Drupal](http://drupal.org) – an open-source, widely used (UN, the White House, many companies) web development platform implemented, primarily, in PHP. There is a strong and very inclusive community around Drupal that is very welcoming to young developers. Drupal is strongly multi-national with good multi-lingual support. It would be an excellent platform for projects and there are many levels where a student could participate in the community.

* [Exercism](http://exercism.io) – a crowd-sourced code review site. Exercises are posted and you complete them and then share your code for review.

* [Global Day of Code Retreat](http://globalday.coderetreat.org/) – an opportunity for programmers to take a day off to hone their craft. I'd highly recommend finding one near you and going, or if there isn't one, then host one of your own. It is a very interesting experience. The site has very useful resources for organizing a code retreat and many of the ideas seem like they would be very useful in the classroom.

## Misc

* [Jargon File](http://www.catb.org/~esr/jargon/) – a "dictionary" of hacker (old sense of the word) vocabulary going back, at least, to the '70s. Of historical interest at the very least.

* [ARPANET circa 1977](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/bf/Arpanet_logical_map%2C_march_1977.png) – logical map of what would become the Internet back when the [PDP-10](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDP-10) ruled the world.
