Resources for teaching IB CS.

# Curricular Stuff

* [Exploring Computer Science](http://exploringcs.org) (ECS) – this is an excellent introduction to CS. The curriculum is designed to scaffold learning for "non-traditional" CS students and the materials are created with the explicit intention of supporting equity in CS education. The section on Problem Solving is an excellent introduction to problem solving and computational thinking. It would be a good MYP level introduction to CS.

* [CS Unplugged](http://csunplugged.com) – resources for teaching CS without a computer. The activities around algorithms work well at the high school level (late MYP, even DP). There is a downloadable text and online resources.

## Books

* [Practical Object-Oriented Design in Ruby:
An Agile Primer](http://poodr.com), by Sandi Metz – this book is an easily read (almost) introduction to OOP and Agile methods using Ruby. It is not a Ruby text, but the Ruby examples are quite accessible. An added bonus is that the author is a woman, so you get a positive role model at the same time.

* [Code Complete](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_Complete), by Steve McConnell – a huge, and very readable text on software development methodology. Either edition is usable.

* [TCP/IP Illustrated](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TCP/IP_Illustrated), by W. Richard Stephens – this is a three-volume set of books that provide an accessible, in-depth, look at the TCP/IP protocol suite. The books were first published in 1994 and have been revised a couple of times since. The core ideas haven't changed much, so if you are on a budget get the early editions – you can often get very good deals on them.

  The genius of these books is the job Stephens does of explaining the thought process that lets you learn first hand about networking protocols. I highly, highly recommend these as a classroom resource.

## Software / Development Tools

* [GitHub](https://github.com) – online developer community built around the git version control system. Offers educational tools and web hosting. The site is the repository for many open source projects and exposure to it would provide students with valuable experience and insight into "real world" softeware development and collaboration.

* [Atom](http://atom.io) – open source programmer's editor loosely reminiscent of [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com). Freely available and runs on OS X, Linux, and Windows.

* [JetBrains](https://www.jetbrains.com) – commercial developer of IDEs for a number of languages / development scenarios. They have products to support Java and web development. The OO support is good. They are very supportive of educational applications. Last I checked classroom licenses were free.

* [Saleae](https://www.saleae.com) – makers of inexpensive logic analyzers with USB interfaces. The devices are very well made and they offer good pricing for educational uses.

* USB Oscilloscopes – a number of companies make USB interfaces to an oscilloscope "front end" with the display running in an application on your computer. I got one called an [Xscope Plain](http://www.gabotronics.com/oscilloscopes/xprotolab-plain.htm) for $20 US.

* **Arduino**

 The Arduino is a playing card sized single-board computer based around the Atmel Atmega328 microcontroller. Prices are relatively low (around $25 US for a single board) and there is a huge variety of project descriptions and tutorials on the web. The Arudino would be an excellent platform for an IA or EE project.

 * [Official Arudino Site](arduino.cc) – this is the canonical resource if you're looking for information and resorces related to the Aruduio. The IDE is downloadable from this site.

 * [Adafruit](http://adafruit.com) – source for components and excellent tutorials. The site is built around the idea that hacking and learning are activities worth doing and supporting. There are excellent resources and project ideas for the Aruduino, Raspberry Pi and several other similar boards. The discussion forums provide access to people working on the tutorials. The site is also great inspiration for young women exploring career ideas in CS and electronics.

## Online Resources

* StackOverflow

* [IRC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Relay_Chat) – Internet Relay Chat is a tool, kind of like instant messaging from the '80s, that is used to support real-time collaboration on many open source projects. There are free IRC clients for most every OS that saw the light of day in the last 30 or so years. Many open source projects host their IRC channels on [Freenode](https://freenode.net/). You really have to experience it.
