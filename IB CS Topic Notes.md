## Logic Gates

* [From NAND to Tetris](http://www.nand2tetris.org) – this is a curriculum in which students "build" a working computer from the ground up, starting with Boolean logic and progress up through CPU architecture to assemblers and compilers to an OS on which they can write and play games. The first sections on digital logic build fundamental logic gates in an HDL and run them on a hardware simulator. There is more here than would fit into the time allotted in the DP CS curriculum, however it might work well in MYP Design or as an IA or EE topic.

## Web Development

### JavaScript and it's derivatives

* [CoffeeScript]()
* [TypeScript](http://www.typescriptlang.org) – Microsoft's statically typed JavaScript extension.
