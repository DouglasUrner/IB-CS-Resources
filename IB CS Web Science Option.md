IB CS Web Science Option
========================

My idea for this option is to teach web application development using an object oriented language (JavaScript or Ruby are my first thoughts) with a database backend. I would like to model several possibilities and then let students pursue their own choice of tools. For example a student could develop in Meteor or use Ruby on Rails.

## Object Oriented Programming

## Database Concepts
