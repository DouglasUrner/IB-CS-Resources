#### 2.1.11 Simple Logic Gates: Boolean operators (AND, OR, NOT, XOR, NAND, NOR)

Logic gate manipulatives for logic gates:

* [littleBits](littlebits.cc) – magnetic blocks that implement individual logic gates and input/output devices (switches and lights). Don't know if there is a way to make a custom kit.

Simulating logic gates. Shimon Schocken's [NAND to Tetris](http://nand2tetris.org) uses a simple HDL and a hardware simulator written in Java. Test scripts let you see how the gates process a variety of inputs. Output is a truth table.
